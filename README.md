--->Hi, my name is Sergo, I am a developer of DLL libraries, applications, a designer, a natural scientist, I automate many routine processes, suggest new ideas, and so on.
I always know how to listen to the interlocutor, to accept a different point of view if it is correct. Therefore, I am always ready to listen to all ideas and suggestions.
The scope of my work is far from limited to just writing code in any language. Therefore, join whoever you are, any talent or field of activity will always be useful for all of us)
